## How the Lottery Works

The Real Estate Lottery System is designed to fairly allocate available housing units to applicants based on configurable scoring rules. Think of it as a sophisticated "weighted raffle" system.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. **Applications Collection**
- People submit applications with their personal information (income, occupation, family size, etc.)
- All valid applications go into a "lottery pool"

#### 2. **Scoring Each Applicant**
- The system calculates a score for each applicant based on predefined rules
- **Score Formula**: `Total Score = (Rule 1 Score) + (Rule 2 Score) + ... + (Rule N Score)`
- **Individual Rule Score**: `Base Weight √ó Value Weight`

#### 3. **Ranking Applicants**
- All applicants are sorted by their total score (highest to lowest)
- Higher scores = better chance of getting a unit

#### 4. **Unit Allocation**
- Winners are selected starting from the highest score
- If there are 10 units available, the top 10 scored applicants win
- **Tie-breaking**: If multiple people have the same score at the cutoff point, winners are chosen randomly among them

#### 5. **Results**
- **Winners**: Get assigned a specific unit
- **Waitlist**: Remaining applicants are ranked in order for future availability

### Real Example
Let's say there are **3 units available** and **5 applicants**:

| Applicant | Score | Result |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Alice     | 8.5   | ‚úÖ **Winner** (Unit A) |
| Bob       | 7.2   | ‚úÖ **Winner** (Unit B) |
| Charlie   | 7.2   | ‚úÖ **Winner** (Unit C) - *Random selection among tied scores* |
| Diana     | 7.2   | ‚ùå Waitlist #1 - *Random selection among tied scores* |
| Eve       | 5.1   | ‚ùå Waitlist #2 |

## Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Basic Income-Based Preference

**Scenario**: Prioritize lower-income applicants for affordable housing

```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "formId": "personalInfo",
      "fieldName": "grossAnnualIncome",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Below 3 Lakhs", "weight": 3.0 },
        { "value": "3-6 Lakhs", "weight": 2.0 },
        { "value": "6-10 Lakhs", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Above 10 Lakhs", "weight": 0.5 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What this does**:
- Someone earning "Below 3 Lakhs" gets: `1.0 √ó 3.0 = 3.0 points`
- Someone earning "Above 10 Lakhs" gets: `1.0 √ó 0.5 = 0.5 points`

### Example 2: Multi-Factor Scoring

**Scenario**: Consider income, occupation, and disability status

```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "formId": "personalInfo",
      "fieldName": "grossAnnualIncome",
      "baseWeight": 0.5,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Below 3 Lakhs", "weight": 3.0 },
        { "value": "3-6 Lakhs", "weight": 2.0 },
        { "value": "Above 6 Lakhs", "weight": 1.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "formId": "personalInfo", 
      "fieldName": "occupation",
      "baseWeight": 0.3,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Govt. Service", "weight": 2.5 },
        { "value": "Private Service", "weight": 2.0 },
        { "value": "Self Employed", "weight": 1.5 },
        { "value": "Unemployed", "weight": 3.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "formId": "personalInfo",
      "fieldName": "isDisabled", 
      "baseWeight": 0.8,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "true", "weight": 2.0 },
        { "value": "false", "weight": 1.0 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Sample Calculation**:
For an applicant who is:
- Low income (Below 3 Lakhs): `0.5 √ó 3.0 = 1.5`
- Government employee: `0.3 √ó 2.5 = 0.75`
- Not disabled: `0.8 √ó 1.0 = 0.8`
- **Total Score**: `1.5 + 0.75 + 0.8 = 3.05`

### Example 3: Fair/Balanced Configuration

**Scenario**: Minimize bias by using equal weights

```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "formId": "personalInfo",
      "fieldName": "grossAnnualIncome",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Below 3 Lakhs", "weight": 1.2 },
        { "value": "3-6 Lakhs", "weight": 1.1 },
        { "value": "6-10 Lakhs", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Above 10 Lakhs", "weight": 0.9 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "formId": "personalInfo",
      "fieldName": "familySize", 
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "1-2 members", "weight": 0.9 },
        { "value": "3-4 members", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "5+ members", "weight": 1.1 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Understanding Bias vs Fairness

### What is Bias in This Context?

**Bias** occurs when the lottery system heavily favors specific groups over others. This isn't necessarily bad - it depends on your housing program's goals.

### What is Fairness?

**Fairness** means giving more equal opportunities to all applicants, regardless of their characteristics.

### The Bias-Fairness Spectrum

```
HIGH BIAS                           BALANCED                         HIGH FAIRNESS
(Strong Preferences)                                                (Equal Treatment)
        |                              |                                    |
   Targets specific              Some preference for           Nearly equal chance
   groups heavily               priority groups               for all applicants
```

### Visual Example: Weight Impact

Consider scoring based on income level:

#### **High Bias Configuration** (Strongly favors high income)
```json
"valueMap": [
  { "value": "Low Income", "weight": 0.2 },     // üìâ Major disadvantage
  { "value": "Medium Income", "weight": 1.0 },  // üìä Baseline
  { "value": "High Income", "weight": 5.0 }     // üìà Very high advantage
]
```

**Result**: High-income applicants have 25x better scoring than low-income applicants

#### **Balanced Configuration** (Moderate preference)
```json
"valueMap": [
  { "value": "Low Income", "weight": 0.8 },     // üìâ Slight disadvantage  
  { "value": "Medium Income", "weight": 1.0 },  // üìä Baseline
  { "value": "High Income", "weight": 1.3 }     // üìà Slight advantage
]
```

**Result**: High-income applicants have 1.6x better scoring than low-income applicants

#### **Fair Configuration** (Nearly equal treatment)
```json
"valueMap": [
  { "value": "Low Income", "weight": 1.0 },     // üìä Equal
  { "value": "Medium Income", "weight": 1.0 },  // üìä Equal  
  { "value": "High Income", "weight": 1.0 }     // üìä Equal
]
```

**Result**: All income groups have equal opportunity

### Bias Warning Signs

‚ùå **High Bias Indicators**:
- Weight differences greater than 3:1 ratio
- Only one group gets high weights while others get very low weights
- Many rules all favor the same small group

‚úÖ **Balanced Indicators**:
- Weight differences within 2:1 ratio
- Multiple groups receive preference across different rules
- Diverse criteria that don't all benefit the same applicants

### Detailed Examples: Fairness vs Bias vs Randomization

Let's walk through concrete examples showing how different configurations affect outcomes, including how randomization works for tie-breaking.

#### **Scenario Setup**
We have **3 units available** and **6 applicants** with the following profiles:

| Applicant | Income | Credit Score | Occupation |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Alice** | High (‚Çπ12L) | Excellent | Private Service |
| **Bob** | Medium (‚Çπ5L) | Good | Govt Service |
| **Charlie** | Low (‚Çπ2L) | Poor | Unemployed |
| **Diana** | High (‚Çπ15L) | Excellent | Private Service |
| **Eve** | Medium (‚Çπ6L) | Good | Private Service |
| **Frank** | Low (‚Çπ3L) | Good | Govt Service |

---

#### **Example 1: FAIR Configuration (Equal Treatment)**

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "fieldName": "grossAnnualIncome",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Low", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Medium", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "High", "weight": 1.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "creditScore",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Poor", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Good", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Excellent", "weight": 1.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "occupation",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Unemployed", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Private Service", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Govt Service", "weight": 1.0 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Score Calculations:**
- **Alice**: (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) = **3.0**
- **Bob**: (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) = **3.0**
- **Charlie**: (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) = **3.0**
- **Diana**: (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) = **3.0**
- **Eve**: (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) = **3.0**
- **Frank**: (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) = **3.0**

**Result:** All applicants have identical scores = **3.0**

**üé≤ RANDOMIZATION KICKS IN:**
Since all 6 applicants are tied at 3.0 and we need to select 3 winners, the system randomly selects 3 out of 6.

**Possible Outcome:**
- ‚úÖ **Winners** (randomly selected): Bob, Eve, Frank
- ‚ùå **Waitlist**: Alice (#1), Diana (#2), Charlie (#3)

**Fairness Level**: 100% - Everyone has equal opportunity

---

#### **Example 2: BIASED Configuration (Favors High Income)**

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "fieldName": "grossAnnualIncome",
      "baseWeight": 3.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Low", "weight": 0.5 },
        { "value": "Medium", "weight": 1.5 },
        { "value": "High", "weight": 4.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "creditScore",
      "baseWeight": 2.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Poor", "weight": 0.3 },
        { "value": "Good", "weight": 1.5 },
        { "value": "Excellent", "weight": 3.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "occupation",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Unemployed", "weight": 0.2 },
        { "value": "Private Service", "weight": 2.0 },
        { "value": "Govt Service", "weight": 2.5 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Score Calculations:**
- **Alice**: (3.0 √ó 4.0) + (2.0 √ó 3.0) + (1.0 √ó 2.0) = 12.0 + 6.0 + 2.0 = **20.0**
- **Bob**: (3.0 √ó 1.5) + (2.0 √ó 1.5) + (1.0 √ó 2.5) = 4.5 + 3.0 + 2.5 = **10.0**
- **Charlie**: (3.0 √ó 0.5) + (2.0 √ó 0.3) + (1.0 √ó 0.2) = 1.5 + 0.6 + 0.2 = **2.3**
- **Diana**: (3.0 √ó 4.0) + (2.0 √ó 3.0) + (1.0 √ó 2.0) = 12.0 + 6.0 + 2.0 = **20.0**
- **Eve**: (3.0 √ó 1.5) + (2.0 √ó 1.5) + (1.0 √ó 2.0) = 4.5 + 3.0 + 2.0 = **9.5**
- **Frank**: (3.0 √ó 0.5) + (2.0 √ó 1.5) + (1.0 √ó 2.5) = 1.5 + 3.0 + 2.5 = **7.0**

**Ranking:**
1. **Alice & Diana**: 20.0 (tied)
2. **Bob**: 10.0
3. **Eve**: 9.5
4. **Frank**: 7.0
5. **Charlie**: 2.3

**üé≤ RANDOMIZATION FOR TIES:**
Alice and Diana are tied for 1st place. Since we have 3 units:
- Both Alice and Diana automatically win (they're clearly in top 3)
- The 3rd spot goes to Bob (next highest score)

**Final Result:**
- ‚úÖ **Winners**: Alice, Diana, Bob
- ‚ùå **Waitlist**: Eve (#1), Frank (#2), Charlie (#3)

**Bias Level**: High - Strongly favors high-income applicants (Alice/Diana scored 8.7x higher than Charlie)

---

#### **Example 3: BALANCED Configuration (Moderate Bias)**

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "fieldName": "grossAnnualIncome",
      "baseWeight": 1.2,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Low", "weight": 0.8 },
        { "value": "Medium", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "High", "weight": 1.3 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "creditScore",
      "baseWeight": 1.5,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Poor", "weight": 0.7 },
        { "value": "Good", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Excellent", "weight": 1.4 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "occupation",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Unemployed", "weight": 0.6 },
        { "value": "Private Service", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Govt Service", "weight": 1.2 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Score Calculations:**
- **Alice**: (1.2 √ó 1.3) + (1.5 √ó 1.4) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) = 1.56 + 2.1 + 1.0 = **4.66**
- **Bob**: (1.2 √ó 1.0) + (1.5 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.2) = 1.2 + 1.5 + 1.2 = **3.9**
- **Charlie**: (1.2 √ó 0.8) + (1.5 √ó 0.7) + (1.0 √ó 0.6) = 0.96 + 1.05 + 0.6 = **2.61**
- **Diana**: (1.2 √ó 1.3) + (1.5 √ó 1.4) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) = 1.56 + 2.1 + 1.0 = **4.66**
- **Eve**: (1.2 √ó 1.0) + (1.5 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.0) = 1.2 + 1.5 + 1.0 = **3.7**
- **Frank**: (1.2 √ó 0.8) + (1.5 √ó 1.0) + (1.0 √ó 1.2) = 0.96 + 1.5 + 1.2 = **3.66**

**Ranking:**
1. **Alice & Diana**: 4.66 (tied)
2. **Bob**: 3.9
3. **Eve**: 3.7
4. **Frank**: 3.66
5. **Charlie**: 2.61

**üé≤ RANDOMIZATION FOR TIES:**
Alice and Diana tied for 1st place. Both automatically win, plus Bob gets the 3rd spot.

**Final Result:**
- ‚úÖ **Winners**: Alice, Diana, Bob
- ‚ùå **Waitlist**: Eve (#1), Frank (#2), Charlie (#3)

**Bias Level**: Moderate - Slight preference for high-income applicants (Alice/Diana scored 1.8x higher than Charlie)

---

#### **Complex Tie-Breaking Example**

Let's say we had a different scenario where the scores were:

| Applicant | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Alice | 5.2 |
| Bob | 4.1 |
| Charlie | 4.1 |
| Diana | 4.1 |
| Eve | 3.8 |
| Frank | 3.8 |

With **3 units available:**

1. **Alice** automatically wins (highest score: 5.2)
2. **Bob, Charlie, Diana** are tied at 4.1 for spots #2 and #3
3. **üé≤ Randomization**: System randomly selects 2 out of these 3 tied applicants
4. **Eve & Frank** go to waitlist (lower scores)

**Possible Outcome:**
- ‚úÖ **Winners**: Alice, Charlie, Diana (Bob randomly excluded from tie)
- ‚ùå **Waitlist**: Bob (#1), Eve (#2), Frank (#3)

**Key Point**: Even with identical scores, some tied applicants may not win due to limited units.

### Real Estate Lottery Examples: Income, Property Preference & Occupation

Let's use more realistic real estate fields to show fairness vs bias vs randomization in action.

#### **Scenario Setup**
We have **2 premium units available** and **5 applicants**:

| Applicant | Gross Annual Income | Property Preference | Occupation |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Raj** | ‚Çπ8 Lakhs | 2BHK | Software Engineer |
| **Priya** | ‚Çπ15 Lakhs | 3BHK | Doctor |
| **Amit** | ‚Çπ4 Lakhs | 1BHK | Teacher |
| **Neha** | ‚Çπ12 Lakhs | 2BHK | Bank Manager |
| **Suresh** | ‚Çπ6 Lakhs | 2BHK | Government Officer |

**Available Units:**
- Unit A: 2BHK Premium 
- Unit B: 3BHK Premium

---

#### **Example 1: FAIR Configuration (Equal Treatment)**

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "fieldName": "grossAnnualIncome",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Below 5 Lakhs", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "5-10 Lakhs", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Above 10 Lakhs", "weight": 1.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "propertyPreference",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "1BHK", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "2BHK", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "3BHK", "weight": 1.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "occupation",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Teacher", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Software Engineer", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Doctor", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Bank Manager", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Government Officer", "weight": 1.0 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step-by-Step Score Calculations:**

**Raj** (‚Çπ8L, 2BHK, Software Engineer):
- Income: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- Property: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0  
- Occupation: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- **Total Score: 3.0**

**Priya** (‚Çπ15L, 3BHK, Doctor):
- Income: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- Property: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- Occupation: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- **Total Score: 3.0**

**Amit** (‚Çπ4L, 1BHK, Teacher):
- Income: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- Property: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- Occupation: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- **Total Score: 3.0**

**Neha** (‚Çπ12L, 2BHK, Bank Manager):
- Income: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- Property: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- Occupation: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- **Total Score: 3.0**

**Suresh** (‚Çπ6L, 2BHK, Government Officer):
- Income: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- Property: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- Occupation: 1.0 √ó 1.0 = 1.0
- **Total Score: 3.0**

**Result:** All 5 applicants tied at **3.0**

**üé≤ RANDOMIZATION PROCESS:**
Since all applicants have identical scores and we need to select 2 winners from 5 applicants, the system randomly selects 2.

**Random Selection Algorithm:**
1. Put all 5 names in a "digital hat": [Raj, Priya, Amit, Neha, Suresh]
2. Randomly draw 2 names
3. Assign units based on their property preference

**Possible Outcome:**
- üéØ **Random Draw**: Amit and Neha selected
- ‚úÖ **Winner 1**: Amit gets Unit A (2BHK) - closest to his 1BHK preference
- ‚úÖ **Winner 2**: Neha gets Unit B (3BHK) - matches her 2BHK preference well
- ‚ùå **Waitlist**: Raj (#1), Priya (#2), Suresh (#3)

**Fairness Level: 100%** - Everyone had equal 40% chance (2/5) of winning

#### **Example 4: TIE-BREAKING with Randomization**

Let's modify the scores to create a tie scenario:

**Modified Balanced Configuration Results:**
1. **Priya**: 4.2
2. **Neha**: 4.2 (tied for 1st)
3. **Raj**: 4.2 (tied for 1st)
4. **Suresh**: 3.6
5. **Amit**: 3.1

**Scenario:** 3-way tie for top positions, but only 2 units available.

**üé≤ RANDOMIZATION PROCESS:**

**Step 1:** Identify tied applicants at highest score
- Tied at 4.2: Priya, Neha, Raj

**Step 2:** Random selection among tied applicants
- Put tied names in digital hat: [Priya, Neha, Raj]
- Need to select 2 winners from 3 tied applicants
- Random draw algorithm selects 2

**Step 3:** Possible random outcomes

**Outcome A (Random selection: Priya + Neha):**
- ‚úÖ **Winner 1**: Priya gets Unit B (3BHK)
- ‚úÖ **Winner 2**: Neha gets Unit A (2BHK)
- ‚ùå **Waitlist**: Raj (#1), Suresh (#2), Amit (#3)

**Outcome B (Random selection: Priya + Raj):**
- ‚úÖ **Winner 1**: Priya gets Unit B (3BHK)
- ‚úÖ **Winner 2**: Raj gets Unit A (2BHK)
- ‚ùå **Waitlist**: Neha (#1), Suresh (#2), Amit (#3)

**Outcome C (Random selection: Neha + Raj):**
- ‚úÖ **Winner 1**: Neha gets Unit A (2BHK)
- ‚úÖ **Winner 2**: Raj gets Unit B (3BHK)
- ‚ùå **Waitlist**: Priya (#1), Suresh (#2), Amit (#3)

**Key Insights:**
- Each tied applicant has 66.7% chance (2/3) of winning
- Suresh and Amit are automatically waitlisted (lower scores)
- Even qualified applicants with identical scores may lose due to randomization
- Property matching happens after winner selection

---

### Summary: Fairness vs Bias vs Randomization

| Configuration Type | Score Variance | Winner Predictability | Randomization Role |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Fair** | All identical | Pure random | 100% determines winners |
| **Biased** | High variance | Highly predictable | Rarely needed |
| **Balanced** | Moderate variance | Mostly predictable | Occasional tie-breaking |

The lottery system provides flexibility to achieve different goals - from pure fairness (random selection) to strategic bias (preferred customer types) to balanced approaches that consider multiple factors moderately.

## Why This Lottery Engine is Flexible and Well-Designed

### üîß **Architectural Flexibility**

The lottery engine is built with a modular, configuration-driven architecture that separates **policy** from **implementation**. This design allows for maximum adaptability without code changes.

#### **1. Dynamic Configuration System**
```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "fieldName": "ANY_FIELD_NAME",
      "baseWeight": "ADJUSTABLE_IMPORTANCE", 
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "ANY_VALUE", "weight": "CUSTOM_MULTIPLIER" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Flexibility Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Add new criteria** without touching code
- ‚úÖ **Modify scoring rules** in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Support unlimited field types** (income, age, location, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Create complex multi-factor scoring** with any combination

---

### üèóÔ∏è **Robust Design Principles**

#### **1. Separation of Concerns**
```
üìä SCORING ENGINE    ‚Üê‚Üí    üé≤ RANDOMIZATION    ‚Üê‚Üí    üè† ALLOCATION
   (Calculates scores)     (Handles ties)          (Assigns units)
        ‚Üï                       ‚Üï                       ‚Üï
üìã CONFIGURATION      ‚Üê‚Üí    üîß AUDIT SYSTEM    ‚Üê‚Üí    üìà REPORTING
   (Business rules)        (Tracks changes)        (Results & logs)
```

**Each component is independent**, allowing changes to one without affecting others.

#### **2. Fault Tolerance & Edge Case Handling**

**Tie-Breaking Robustness:**
```javascript
// Handles any number of tied applicants
if (tiedApplicants.length > availableUnits) {
  randomlySelect(tiedApplicants, availableUnits);
} else {
  allTiedApplicantsWin(tiedApplicants);
}
```

**Data Validation:**
```javascript
// Prevents configuration errors
validateWeights(config.userPreferenceRules);
validateFieldNames(applicantData, config);
ensurePositiveWeights(config.valueMap);
```

## Practical Tuning Advice

### For Prioritizing Fairness (Equal Opportunity)

#### ‚úÖ **Do This:**
1. **Use similar base weights** across all rules (e.g., all between 0.8-1.2)
2. **Keep value weight ratios small** (max 2:1 difference)
3. **Include diverse criteria** that benefit different groups
4. **Test different combinations** and review the results

#### **Example Fair Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "fieldName": "grossAnnualIncome",
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Low", "weight": 1.1 },
        { "value": "Medium", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "High", "weight": 0.9 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "familySize", 
      "baseWeight": 1.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Small", "weight": 0.9 },
        { "value": "Medium", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Large", "weight": 1.1 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "residencyDuration",
      "baseWeight": 1.0, 
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "New", "weight": 0.9 },
        { "value": "Medium", "weight": 1.0 },
        { "value": "Long-term", "weight": 1.1 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### For Prioritizing Bias (Targeted Preferences)

#### ‚úÖ **Do This:**
1. **Use high base weights** for priority characteristics (1.5-3.0)
2. **Create large value weight differences** (up to 5:1 ratio)
3. **Align multiple rules** to benefit the same target groups
4. **Clearly document the intended beneficiaries**

#### **Example Biased Configuration:**
```json
{
  "userPreferenceRules": [
    {
      "fieldName": "grossAnnualIncome",
      "baseWeight": 2.0,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Below 3 Lakhs", "weight": 0.5 },
        { "value": "3-6 Lakhs", "weight": 2.0 },
        { "value": "Above 6 Lakhs", "weight": 4.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "creditScore",
      "baseWeight": 1.5,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Poor", "weight": 0.5 },
        { "value": "Good", "weight": 2.0 },
        { "value": "Excellent", "weight": 3.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "occupation",
      "baseWeight": 1.2,
      "valueMap": [
        { "value": "Unemployed", "weight": 0.3 },
        { "value": "Private Service", "weight": 2.0 },
        { "value": "Govt. Service", "weight": 3.5 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Testing and Validation

#### **Before Going Live:**

1. **Run test scenarios** with sample data
2. **Calculate scores** for different applicant profiles
3. **Check if results align** with your program goals
4. **Document your reasoning** for the chosen weights

#### **Sample Test Cases:**

| Profile | Income | Occupation | Disabled | Expected Outcome |
|---------|--------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Profile A | Low | Unemployed | Yes | Should score very high |
| Profile B | High | Private | No | Should score lower |
| Profile C | Medium | Govt | No | Should score medium |

#### **Monitoring After Launch:**

- Track which groups are winning most units
- Collect feedback from applicants and stakeholders
- Adjust weights if results don't match intended goals
- Keep audit logs of all configuration changes

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Set all base weights to 0 (everyone gets same score)
- Create impossible combinations (conflicting high preferences)
- Change weights during an active lottery period
- Ignore testing with real data

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Start with moderate settings and adjust gradually
- Keep detailed documentation of all changes
- Involve stakeholders in reviewing configurations
- Plan for edge cases and tie-breaking scenarios

---

## Summary

The Real Estate Lottery System provides powerful tools for customizing unit allocation. The key is understanding:

1. **How scoring works**: Base Weight √ó Value Weight for each rule
2. **Bias vs Fairness trade-off**: Higher weight differences = more bias toward preferred groups
3. **Configuration impact**: Small weight changes can significantly affect outcomes
4. **Testing importance**: Always validate with sample data before going live

Remember: There's no "perfect" configuration - it depends entirely on your housing program's specific goals and target beneficiaries.
